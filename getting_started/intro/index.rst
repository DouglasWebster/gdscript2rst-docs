The utility gdscript2rest was written so that gdscript API comments can be converted to
reStructuredText format for including in documentation.

Whilst the utility function is to generate reStructuredText files the main focus was to
include these files in a Sphinx document.  This documentation will detail the procedures
and tools required to complete this task.

=========

I am not a professional writer so please feel free to raise queries/faults in the 
`Issues <https://github.com/DouglasWebster/gdscript2rst-docs/issues>`_  section of the github page
for this document.

Likewise any issues with the programs can be raised in their appropriate github page.

I shall be looking at the Godot 4 release and seeing how it behaves with this software.  From initial
reading it could well be that the need for something like this is greatly reduced but in the end good
documentation is still vital.  Not everything can be covered by *docstrings* - if it could we would
not have the vast amount of tutorials for every language I've tried!

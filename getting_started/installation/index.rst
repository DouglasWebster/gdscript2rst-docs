Installation

The following sections deal with installing the tools required to create
both the reStructuredText files and the Sphinx document files for a 
project.  If all you require are the reStructuredText files then only
the first three items are required.

.. warning:: 

   Many of the following instructions deal with installing python modules.  Depending on which
   python package manager you use (see :ref:`pip_install`) without configuring your project is
   probably not the best thing to do.  If you install from a newly opened terminal or cmd window
   then the module could be inserted globally. For python projects it is strongly recommended to
   use virtual environments which will be covered later in this document.

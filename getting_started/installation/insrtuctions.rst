Python
======

Installing python is beyond the scope of this document.  If you need to install python and are unsure
how to do it then the following taken from the Python website should be followed.

.. admonition:: `BeginnersGuide <https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/>`_ 

    Installing Python is generally easy, and nowadays many Linux and UNIX 
    distributions include a recent Python. Even some Windows computers 
    (notably those from HP) now come with Python already installed. 
    If you do need to install Python and aren't confident about the task 
    you can find a few notes on the 
    `BeginnersGuide/Download <http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download>`_ 
    wiki page, but installation is unremarkable on most platforms.

Godot
=====

If you are using this program then I assume you have Godot installed and are familiar with it!
But, just in case, installation instructions can be found at 
`Godot Download Page <https://godotengine.org/download>`_

.. instructions for installing the python environment

Python
======

Installing python is beyond the scope of this document.  If you need to install python and are unsure
how to do it then the following taken from the Python website should be followed.

.. admonition:: `BeginnersGuide <https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/>`_ 

    Installing Python is generally easy, and nowadays many Linux and UNIX 
    distributions include a recent Python. Even some Windows computers 
    (notably those from HP) now come with Python already installed. 
    If you do need to install Python and aren't confident about the task 
    you can find a few notes on the 
    `BeginnersGuide/Download <http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download>`_ 
    wiki page, but installation is unremarkable on most platforms.

.. _pip_install:

Pip
===

Pip is the package management system used throughout this guide.  It is not unusual for it 
to be installed when python is installed but if not then the installation and usage instructions can
be found at https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/

.. note::

    Pip is not the only package manager for python, two good alternatives I have used in the 
    past being `Conda <https://conda.pydata.org/>`_ and `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_.
